                        For many, hiking in Peru is synonymous with hiking to Machu Picchu. The former Inca city is one
                        of
                        them
                        most famous sights, not only in Peru but throughout South America. And no wonder, this one
                        historical site was named one of the world's seven wonders in 2007

                        large and
                        majestic archaeological site located about 25 miles (40 km) north of Mexico City. It is famous

                        its
                        large pyramids dedicated to the sun and the moon, but the site also contains beautiful murals

                        carvings and several museums through which you can explore the city's fascinating history. This

                        migration of wildebeest and zebras, as hundreds of thousands of animals move between Kenya and

                        in search of food. Equally exciting are the climbs to Africa's highest mountain, Kilimanjaro.
